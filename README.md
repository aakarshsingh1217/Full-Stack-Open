# Full-Stack-Open
University of Helsinki's Full Stack Web Development course: https://fullstackopen.com/en/

> After completing the Foundations section along with several other sections of The Odin Project, which provided me with a solid grounding in web development, I am now embarking on the University of Helsinki's "Full Stack Open" course. This repository will document my journey as I delve deeper into mastering modern web development, focusing on React, advanced JavaScript, and full-stack frameworks. My goal is to build upon the fundamental skills Iâ€™ve acquired, transitioning into more complex and sophisticated development practices, and enhancing my proficiency in creating dynamic, scalable, and responsive web applications.

### Other web dev experience
> I have completed the Foundations section, the Intermediate HTML/CSS section, the Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs, the Objects and Object Constructors, the Classes, and the ES6 Modules parts of the JavaScript section of The Odin Project. I have also learned the ASP.NET framework at university, along with SQL.
